      <strong>About</strong>
      <div class="message">
        This project was originally from my computer class, 
        which is called Fibonacci Computer. However, in the 
        class, the teacher only told us that we, human should 
        perform the assemble-like code, which I thought was 
        terrible. <br>
        Therefore, I made this toy machine to help me with
        those codes. And because the original one does not
        support many features a real computer would have, so
        I made a few changes on it. <br>
        If you want to use the original version, please see
        my old one. <br>
        And I'm working on a compiler for it. <br>
